# Introduction

Images consist of pixels, which is data that you can use to quantify relations between pictures. You can also let a computer interpret the content of an image, using some computer vision algorithm. As these algorithms are generally trained in a machine learning context (almost always some kind of deep learning network), they are always biased with respect to the training they received. Take this bias into account when using machine learning (AI).

An accessible introduction is the book [Distant Viewing -
Computational Exploration of Digital Images](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546133/distant-viewing/) which only recently came out and can be freely accessed a MIT Press. In [chapter 2](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/chapter-pdf/2163341/c001100_9780262375160.pdf)

Maybe something about latent images, i.e. information about a training set that is latently present in networks.
