# Where to find all these images?

## Creating your own picture set
It can unfortunately be quite a hassle to create a nice set of images for your research, despite the many worldwide efforts to make create open access to (cultural) images, such as [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/). If you start with a large collection such as Europeana, or smaller (but still large) images from the [Rijksmuseum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/) or the [Metropolitan](https://www.metmuseum.org), you probably want to
1. download metadata
2. create a selection (e.g. all stereo pictures taken between 1920 and 1940)
3. download the images

Alternatively, you can also create datasets 'manually'. Everyone always wants to automate everything, but in some cases (obviously there are some scaling limits) you can actually select images manually.
