# Where to find all these images?

## Curating your own picture set
It can unfortunately be quite a hassle to create a nice set of images for your research, despite the many worldwide efforts to make create open access to (cultural) images, such as [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/). If you start with a large collection such as Europeana, or smaller (but still large) images from the [Rijksmuseum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/) or the [Metropolitan](https://www.metmuseum.org), you probably want to make it smaller and focus on a certain subset:
1. download metadata
2. create a selection (e.g. all stereo pictures taken between 1920 and 1940)
3. download the images

Alternatively, you can also create datasets 'manually'. Everyone always wants to automate everything, but in some cases (obviously there are some scaling limits) you can actually select images manually.

## Finding preprocessed picture sets

There are places where to you can find preprocessed picture sets on websites that cater to machine learning, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?mod=images). Mind you that these picture sets are not a priori interesting, which is intentional as these sets often need to represent some real world aspect robustly and unbiased. Off course, they rarely do, which is were interesting stuff happens. And even if there is actually nothing interesting, it might still be a good exercise in the first part of the course.

## Investigate latent images

Generative networks were trained on images and can produce images themselves. The production relies on training which is somewhat comparable to human produced pictures (which also represent certain times and places in history). Therefore, you can also choose to study a network with a 'latent' image set: you can generate the dataset yourself and start your study.
