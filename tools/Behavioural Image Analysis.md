# Introduction

We can use the human eye (i.e. human participants)for roughly two purposes:
1. To do something in principle a computer could also do, but you don't know how to program it
2. To do something inherently human (e.g. subjective judgements)

The first reason sounds a bit lame but is perfectly valid and sometimes useful. Given the success of AI over the past years you might have the impression that you can see 'everything' with an appropriate algorithm, but that is simply not the case.
